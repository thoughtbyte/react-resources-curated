## JavaScript

A deep understanding of JavaScript is important before digging into React

- A comprehensive dive into JavaScript: [You Don't Know JS - Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
- A great overview of JavaScript fundamentals, including ES6+: [JavaScript Fundamentals Before Learning React - Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/)
- Asynchronous JavaScript fundamentals: [From Callbacks to Promises to Async/Await - Tyler McGinnis](https://tylermcginnis.com/async-javascript-from-callbacks-to-promises-to-async-await/)
- Asynchronous JavaScript and the event loop,

- [What the Heck is the Event Loop Anyway? - Philip Roberts (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). This is _the_ best discussion of asynchornous JavaScript and the event loop.

## React, General

- [The React docs: read, reread, reread again](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Reading the docs for anything is always a good idea, but the React docs are exceptionally well written and comprehensive.
